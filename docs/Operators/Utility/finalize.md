The `finalize` operator lets you specify a callback function that will be executed **when the source Observable terminates**. Termination happens in one of three ways:

1.  The Observable **completes** successfully (sends its last value and the `complete` notification).
2.  The Observable emits an **error** notification.
3.  The subscription to the Observable is **unsubscribed** (e.g., manually, or automatically via operators like `take`, `takeUntil`, or `takeUntilDestroyed`).

Think of it like the `finally` block in a traditional `try...catch...finally` statement. The code inside `finalize` is **guaranteed** to run _after_ the Observable finishes its work or is stopped, regardless of _why_ it stopped (success, error, or unsubscription).

## Key Points

1.  **Guaranteed Execution on Termination:** Runs whether the stream succeeds, fails, or is unsubscribed.
2.  **No Arguments:** The callback function you provide to `finalize` receives no arguments. It doesn't know _if_ an error occurred or what the last value was; it just knows the stream is done.
3.  **Side Effects Only:** Like `tap`, `finalize` is purely for side effects. It doesn't affect the values, errors, or completion signals passing _through_ the stream (because it runs _after_ them).
4.  **Ideal for Cleanup:** Its primary purpose is resource cleanup or actions that must happen when an operation is finished.

## Why Use `finalize`?

The most common and important use case is **managing loading states**.

- You start an operation (e.g., HTTP request).
- You set a `loading` flag/signal to `true`.
- The operation might succeed or fail.
- You need to ensure the `loading` flag/signal is _always_ set back to `false` when the operation is finished, no matter the outcome. `finalize` is perfect for this.

Other uses include:

- Closing connections (though often handled by unsubscription itself).
- Logging the end of an operation.
- Releasing any temporary resources acquired at the start of the subscription.

## Real-World Example: Managing Loading State for Data Fetching

This is the classic example. We fetch data, show a loading indicator, and use `finalize` to hide the indicator when the fetch completes or fails.

**Explanation:**

1.  When `loadProducts` is called, `loading` is immediately set to `true`, displaying the "Loading products..." message.
2.  `mockFetchProducts` returns an Observable that simulates either success or failure after a delay.
3.  The `pipe` chain processes the result:
    - `tap`: Logs successful data receipt (only runs on success).
    - `catchError`: Catches any error from the source. It sets the `errorMessage` signal and returns `EMPTY`. Returning `EMPTY` makes the stream complete gracefully _after_ the error, ensuring `finalize` still runs.
    - **`finalize(() => { this.loading.set(false); })`**: This is the crucial part. This callback function is registered to run when the stream terminates.
      - If `mockFetchProducts` succeeds, the `next` value passes through `tap`, then the stream completes. `finalize` runs, setting `loading` to `false`.
      - If `mockFetchProducts` fails, the error goes to `catchError`. `catchError` handles it and returns `EMPTY`, which immediately completes the stream. `finalize` runs, setting `loading` to `false`.
      - If the component is destroyed _while_ the fetch is in progress, `takeUntilDestroyed` triggers unsubscription. `finalize` runs, setting `loading` to `false`.
    - `takeUntilDestroyed`: Handles automatic unsubscription.
4.  The `subscribe` block's `next` handler updates the `products` signal only on success.

No matter what happens – success, failure, or component destruction – the `finalize` block ensures that `this.loading.set(false)` is called, correctly cleaning up the UI loading state. This makes it much more reliable than trying to manage the loading flag in both the `error` and `complete`/`next` handlers of the `subscribe` block.
